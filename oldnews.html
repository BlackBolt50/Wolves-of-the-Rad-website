               <p class="scoop">Hello Proletariat and Bourgeoisie,
                <br>
                <br>
                Welcome to the very FIRST EDITION of Senpai’s Scoop!! I am very excited to be spearheading this freshly introduced weekly article, which will cover a variety of topics surrounding fantasy football! However, when I accepted this job (no pay at all) (I should be getting paid, right?) I knew, most importantly, that I wanted to cover YOU, our league mates. As one of the founding members of Wolves of The Rad and former commish (fuck you, Jordan), I have had the wonderful opportunity to watch this league grow into the powerhouse it is now. The one constant through all these years has been you guys and all the terrible yet great storylines and stories our league has. I mean, I bet most of you remember or heard of when Jake Hudson drafted Larry Fitz in round 1…. Or how about how Ben was one of the worst fantasy players ever despite his passion and knowledge for the sport (sorry, Ben.)  Going forward, every week, there will be an in-depth summary and analysis for each of our 14 teams. Including rivalries and blowouts;) With that being said….
                <br>
                <br>
                Welcome to Week 8 of Wolves of The Rad fantasy season!!
                <br>
                There seems no more fitting a place to start than injuries. Suffice it to say, this season has been an absolute roller coaster for injuries, and week 7 provided much more of the same. Injuries to Tampa Bay's star WRs have left teams Freako and Snead facing even more uphill battles, as the injury bug and general retardation (Snead) have stricken their respective camps deeply. 8/14 league members currently find themselves with a record over .500 as the second half of the season is sure to end down to the wire once again. With the recent news of a D Hop trade and the potential return of CMC, the Evil Empire is looking like a team to watch in the second half. Meanwhile, BenDover is coming off 2 straight wins with a deep roster. It so happens that they match up this week, which certainly looks like the game of the week! Be on the lookout for more updates and storylines each week as the second half of the season unfolds, and don’t forget the champ is still here. 
                <br>

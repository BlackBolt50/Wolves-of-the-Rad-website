                <h1>Welcome to the Wolves of the Rad Fantasy Football League website</h1>
                <p>This website is my attempt at cataloguing the past, present, and future our long-running fantasy football league. This site will contain sections dedicated to our league history and past champions, weekly rankings, highest and lowest scores, and more. I'm brand new to this, being my first REAL programming project I've done, so bear with the janky-ness and glitches that may come up. As I develop my programming skills, I'd love to add more features. I'll gladly take any suggestions for content and sections to add. Hopefully this site can be an integral part of our league for years to come!</p>

                Days have passed, weeks have passed, and shit, a whole holiday has passed, but the return is here! Friends, welcome back to the scoop and the (not so) weekly recap for our league. Suffice to say, the holidays are always a busy time for all of us, but it’s instrumental to take a step back and focus on what’s truly important in our lives. That, which I speak so highly of, is of course fantasy football! Thanksgiving is best spent stressing about your fantasy players scoring and less time spent eating grandma's apple pie. Seriously, screw the pie; if David Montgomery doesn’t hit his 13.5 projections on the week, you’re certain to lose to Tiki's GG disgusting aura or his fake fandom. In all seriousness, I’m happy to be back writing and focusing on you peeps and very, very thankful for all of you. Happy Holidays, and let’s get right into it!

                <br>
                Welcome to playoff football! Wolves of the Rad league members and other passionate readers, the time has officially come! After fourteen long weeks, over three months of dedication, countless trials and tribulations, long nights spent browsing the waiver wire, tears and smiles seen and gone, the time has officially arrived. We started this season with fourteen young men, aiming to take their fantasy season to the upper echelon, ever so placing their names in the ranks of the all-time greats. Now we stand at seven. Of the seven remaining, only ONE can become the champion. Now, let us take a good look into the season of these seven teams and a look into our seven absolutely pathetic teams who missed out on the playoffs.
                <br>
                <br>
                There seems to be no more fitting place to start, well, rather a time, than this past Monday night! With less than two minutes in the game and down by nearly ten points, Patty Cake’s chance at a one seed and round one bye looked gloomy. With a matchup against reigning champion Aston Dookey, in which he saw Josh Allen put up over fifty points AND break the fantasy record for QBs. Despite this, all it took was one play to change the outcome for these two teams! With a game-winning and bye-clinching catch and score from star wide receiver Jamar Chase! All year long, Patty Cake has steamed roll throughout his opponents as managers Zion and Shadique are itching for a shot to get the trophy right back! Despite minimal activity throughout the season, Cake has remained a strong team, consistently finding themselves at the top of power rankings! Cake with a round one bye awaits the winner of Saquan Barkley Enthusiast and Njorkin my peener, led by each individual respected manager, “The Jordans.” Njorkin, led by cooler and calmer Jordan, is coming off two straight wins. Led by his very own calm and cool player in Joe Burrow and the double trouble tight end death trap, which is ever so fitting for his team name. However, his team is much more! Behind a thirty-two-point performance from JJettas, Jordan was able to clinch a place in the top seven! He has consistently found himself in the thick of competition year in and year out, and despite long days and nights at work, he continues to impress upper-level league management! Meanwhile, his opponent, evil corrupt commish Jordan, is coming off his first loss after a lengthy winning streak. Before week fourteen, the commish had rattled off seven straight wins, finding himself fully entrenched in the upper echelon of potential playoff teams. The media remains abuzz around this team despite a recent loss, large part in thanks to the league's best running back, Saquon Barkley (I can’t believe I just admitted that). Having scored the third most points in the season, he’s looking to return right back to a winning streak! Another important streak sits at five games. Currently, Freako Collins finds himself on a five-game winning streak and enters the playoffs as one of, if not the hottest, teams in the league. Despite a rough start and substantial injuries, he still found a way to win ten games! With the full-on return of Puka and the PPR breakout of Chase “Ghost of Zach Moss” Brown,” he rolls into round one against the Empire. The Evil Empire, led by manager Will Williams Wallace Wild West Breon has faced a season full of adversity! Recent insider scoop has confirmed that the Empire has begun plans for even more possible expansion in his quest to undertake as many different things at once as possible. Big Business Breon has wheeled and dealed all season long yet again in his quest for a championship! Even with the recent loss of CMacc, he looks to be one of the more star-powered teams in contention. The final team in the playoffs is quite literally the exact opposite of the evil capitalist empire. Our last team in, but certainly not last in our hearts, is Shieldsy Show. Show, led by communist captain Mike himself, has had a rough season, suffice it to say. After starting 7-1, he stumbled in the second half, finishing with a record of 8-6. Regardless, he managed to find his way into the playoffs! In what has been an inverse of the norm for Mike, who typically is a very strong regular season team, maybe things are looking different this year, and he can finally run the table! Despite being one of the most well-rounded teams on paper, he has seen his players disappoint this year, specifically in the second half. However, with the return of Smitty Son and Perk Rodgers slanging that shit, finally, his season could be turning a page at just the right time!
                <br>
                <br>
                For these seven teams, the season can ultimately be deemed a success, all able to reach the playoffs. Unfortunately, things weren't so successful for our seven other teams. A season marked by disappointment, injuries, general stupidity, and terrible coaching decisions, each of these teams enters the offseason facing uncertainty. Despite the uncertainty for many of these owners, one owner in particular knows his fate. With a final record of 2-12, The Promised Land, owned and operated by Jacob, knows his fate! In a punishment fit for the biggest of “bitches" (pun intended), Jacob will have the great luxury of drafting his team from a dog cage next season! Wow, what a total bummer! Don't you totally feel bad for him!? With growing calls for sanctions due to his piss-poor trades and lineup management, will the horror of the cage quell the talks for sanctions? With only seven teams making the playoffs, several teams found themselves on the bubble going into week fourteen. Under Rayted, led by manager Ray, started his season with a bang on the beaches of Brazil! However, his season story was not so hot and sunny! With a season that can best be defined as up and down, and faced with injuries, each week presented a challenge for brother Raymond! From Brazil to the West Coast, our second bubble team features BenDover, managed by Jon. For Jon, being stuck on west coast time seemed to be his biggest downfall! With one of the deeper rosters in the league and a star rookie QB, one would imagine Jon for a better finish. Suffice it to say, his season was marked with disappointment. With the recent acquisition of a new dog and his pending offseason trip to Europe, Jon is looking to completely shut the door on this season. Speaking of shutting the door, the door seems appropriately shut on the status of the management of team The Need for Snead. Coming into the season, Tiki 1-800-money line was pegged as manager. However, as the season unfolded and reports came out of the facility, it became clear that Tim and the Catholic Church were in control. They face the most difficult decisions this offseason as movement looms. Our last team, featuring two co-owners, Ruggs Driving Class, was led by Halseymania and EBabybenson. Many could have predicted this team may struggle, starting all the way back on draft night when owner EB fell asleep during the draft. They're the prime example of how challenging and competitive it can be entering our league over the first few seasons! Just like kicker Younghoe Koo, this season was a bit of a letdown featuring several misses. Meanwhile, on the back 9, Let's Go Golfing, led by owner Brennan Pussy Wrist, had a season best defined as underwhelming. Another team victim to poor performance and injuries, he almost found himself in the doghouse! Thanks in large part to a week fourteen win over Jacob, in which many defined this as one of his better weeks of the season. For Brennan, he enters the offseason in much better spirits than others after his commanding fifty-point victory and removal from the dog cage race! Our final team is led by none other than our website creator and founding father, Kenny. For Gibby, he once again fell into the trap of questionable trades and an eagerness to reach the top! Despite his commitment and passion, this season was not successful, but that's the beauty of fantasy! Faced with injuries as well, he was often challenged with fashioning a winning team on a consistent basis. Other league members suspect that his creation of this glorious website perhaps burdened his fantasy football prowess as the season unfolded.
                <br>

                Leaguemates, thank you for sticking with me this far (if you did). I know it's a lot, and believe me, this took me like 2 plus hours (one of those spent on the shitter). We're in the home stretch! Good luck to our seven teams in the playoffs, especially reigning champion Aston Dookey! The big dogs are officially out to play; this is almost certainly where man or mouse is formed! Another wonderful season, all thanks to you guys! There will definitely be another scoop before the chip, but until then, be good and be safe!

                <p>Of course we have to mention the biggest winner. Mr. Maxwell Milo, Senpai himself, won the 2023 Fantasy Football season! Yeah, we all hate him for it. Yeah, it looks like showing up to the draft in a suit and tie might have some luck built-in. Regardless of that, Max pushed through a rough fantasy season, battled Jacob in the championship, and came out on top! Will Max complete a back-to-back tour? Will Zion come back with a vengeance after his championship hangover season? Or will it be a newcomer to the winner's podium to bring home the hardware? Who will win???</p>

                <p>It must be nice to win the chip... good news for our last place manager, he won a chip too! Our 2023 Fantasy Football season last place performer, Mr. Jesse Schuhart, won the honors of the spicy hot Ghost Pepper chip. What's more painful - losing more games than you win? Or eating this chip? We all watched in horror as Jesse tanked the hot chip, and even worse, half a gallon of milk as a chaser. It must be said in writing though - Jesse took this punishment like an absolute CHAMPION! This day might've even sparked a fire in him for our current season.</p>

                <p>Literally in the dog house. This year, the last place team will spend the duration of the draft in the dog cage. Normally a fun and open time to socialize and have fun, for the ENTIRE DRAFT, you'll have to spend your session drafting from a crate. Best not lose!</p>

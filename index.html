                <h1>Welcome to the Wolves of the Rad Fantasy Football League website</h1>
                <p>This website is my attempt at cataloguing the past, present, and future our long-running fantasy football league. This site will contain sections dedicated to our league history and past champions, weekly rankings, highest and lowest scores, and more. I'm brand new to this, being my first REAL programming project I've done, so bear with the janky-ness and glitches that may come up. As I develop my programming skills, I'd love to add more features. I'll gladly take any suggestions for content and sections to add. Hopefully this site can be an integral part of our league for years to come!</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                Welcome to the second edition of Senpais Scoops! Last week offered a picture-perfect view into the chaos of our league! The game to watch, featuring the Evil Empire vs. BenDover, started off as an enticing matchup but quickly turned south. With a commanding 43-point victory, EVILLLLLLLLLL Empire, backed by his star players, saw his season turnaround in a substantial fashion. Many league members have voiced their expressive opinions about the Empire and his ability to “persuade” his peers into questionable decisions. Backed by the return of CMAC and his ever-growing thirst for trade dominance, the league has been put on notice regarding the Empire's shadow movement. Last week also featured several major upsets. The Promised Land was able to achieve his first win of the season behind a great performance from the Falcons offense. Congratulations to him and his (not) quest to make it to the cage! Meanwhile, don’t look now, but Need for Snead has slowly been finding themselves higher and higher in the rankings each week. Putting up another massive win this weekend against Under Rayted, a team that many had pegged for the playoffs.
                <br>
                <br>
                This week's matchup to watch features our highest-ranked team, Shieldsy Show (7-1), taking on Saquan Barkley Enthusiast (4-4). Shieldsy Show has only one loss on the season and looks to continue his dominance, as his reputation grows as one of the better regular season teams in league history. For Enthusiasts, coming off 2 straight wins and the conviction to take down anyone in his path, he goes as his star player goes, and suffice to say, his star player has been on a roll!

                <p>Of course we have to mention the biggest winner. Mr. Maxwell Milo, Senpai himself, won the 2023 Fantasy Football season! Yeah, we all hate him for it. Yeah, it looks like showing up to the draft in a suit and tie might have some luck built-in. Regardless of that, Max pushed through a rough fantasy season, battled Jacob in the championship, and came out on top! Will Max complete a back-to-back tour? Will Zion come back with a vengeance after his championship hangover season? Or will it be a newcomer to the winner's podium to bring home the hardware? Who will win???</p>

                <p>It must be nice to win the chip... good news for our last place manager, he won a chip too! Our 2023 Fantasy Football season last place performer, Mr. Jesse Schuhart, won the honors of the spicy hot Ghost Pepper chip. What's more painful - losing more games than you win? Or eating this chip? We all watched in horror as Jesse tanked the hot chip, and even worse, half a gallon of milk as a chaser. It must be said in writing though - Jesse took this punishment like an absolute CHAMPION! This day might've even sparked a fire in him for our current season.</p>

                <p>Literally in the dog house. This year, the last place team will spend the duration of the draft in the dog cage. Normally a fun and open time to socialize and have fun, for the ENTIRE DRAFT, you'll have to spend your session drafting from a crate. Best not lose!</p>

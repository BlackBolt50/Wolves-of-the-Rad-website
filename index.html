                <h1>Welcome to the Wolves of the Rad Fantasy Football League website</h1>
                <p>This website is my attempt at cataloguing the past, present, and future our long-running fantasy football league. This site will contain sections dedicated to our league history and past champions, weekly rankings, highest and lowest scores, and more. I'm brand new to this, being my first REAL programming project I've done, so bear with the janky-ness and glitches that may come up. As I develop my programming skills, I'd love to add more features. I'll gladly take any suggestions for content and sections to add. Hopefully this site can be an integral part of our league for years to come!</p>

                <h3>Week 11 Recap</h3>
               </div>
               <p class="scoop">Comrades and Cohorts,
                <br>
                <br>
                The debate has raged on for thousands of years. Every chronic gambler (Tiki), every mathematician (Tom Benjamin), and maybe even you the reader has an opinion. We're talking numbers more specifically, the long time controversial debate of numbers; odd numbers vs. even numbers. However, to end the debate quickly, odd numbers will always remain supreme. This past week, which again, was a microcosmic of this season, can only be described as ”odd”. Let's focus on some important odd numbers from week 11. With the recent removal of divisions, a clear picture of the best 7 teams is developing. Week 11 also featured 3 teams coming off substantial winning streaks in 3 and 5 games respectively. For Aston Dookey, claiming his 3rd straight victory behind 39 and sunny from the god himself, led to the 3rd straight loss for Shieldsy Show. Our second game to watch last week saw Saquon Barkley Enthusiast claim his 5th straight win. From Enthusiast owner, “Despite the rough 2-4 start, my guys have handled adversity well all season, we're all looking forward to a potential playoff matchup vs Patty Cake.” Meanwhile for Cake, he stands as our other team on a substantial winning streak, standing at 3. Last week's final game to watch between Gibby and Snead saw Gibby steamroll his opponent to a 47 point victory! Behind 29 points from Bo Nix and Cooper Kupp. Behind the combined 3 points of Gabe Davis and Scary Terry, Snead stood no chance.. WHEW that was a lot of odd numbers, let's move onto some more even numbers in week 12!
                <br>
                <br>
                Week 12 rolls right in with a hot and cold start on Thursday! With the first snow game of the year, it was a great start for the week! With three games remaining in the regular season, playoffs loom largely. However, what everyone wants to know, who will be visiting the cage next year? Week 12 features our first “toilet bowl” game of the year, with both teams fighting tooth and nail to keep any hopes alive. At 1-10, the land has recently begun reading scripture, hoping that faith can save his season. For Lets Go Golfing, in a season that can be defined with disappointments and a pile of “mid”, he's shooting for the shit, in this ever so important toilet bowl game! With every week becoming more and more important, there will likely be substantial matchups every week. To minimize even more reading for you (honestly kudos if you made it this far) we will briefly touch on more games. The highest ranking game of the week features Show taking on Patty Cake. Playoff hopefuls Gibby, Njorkin, and Under Rayted all battle teams featuring a 7-4 record or better this week. Meanwhile, the Empire and BenDover coming off respective losing streaks are still right in the thick of the playoff hunt and remain some of the league's scariest teams. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Much love - Senpai.

                <p>Of course we have to mention the biggest winner. Mr. Maxwell Milo, Senpai himself, won the 2023 Fantasy Football season! Yeah, we all hate him for it. Yeah, it looks like showing up to the draft in a suit and tie might have some luck built-in. Regardless of that, Max pushed through a rough fantasy season, battled Jacob in the championship, and came out on top! Will Max complete a back-to-back tour? Will Zion come back with a vengeance after his championship hangover season? Or will it be a newcomer to the winner's podium to bring home the hardware? Who will win???</p>

                <p>It must be nice to win the chip... good news for our last place manager, he won a chip too! Our 2023 Fantasy Football season last place performer, Mr. Jesse Schuhart, won the honors of the spicy hot Ghost Pepper chip. What's more painful - losing more games than you win? Or eating this chip? We all watched in horror as Jesse tanked the hot chip, and even worse, half a gallon of milk as a chaser. It must be said in writing though - Jesse took this punishment like an absolute CHAMPION! This day might've even sparked a fire in him for our current season.</p>

                <p>Literally in the dog house. This year, the last place team will spend the duration of the draft in the dog cage. Normally a fun and open time to socialize and have fun, for the ENTIRE DRAFT, you'll have to spend your session drafting from a crate. Best not lose!</p>

                <h1>Welcome to the Wolves of the Rad Fantasy Football League website</h1>
                <p>This website is my attempt at cataloguing the past, present, and future our long-running fantasy football league. This site will contain sections dedicated to our league history and past champions, weekly rankings, highest and lowest scores, and more. I'm brand new to this, being my first REAL programming project I've done, so bear with the janky-ness and glitches that may come up. As I develop my programming skills, I'd love to add more features. I'll gladly take any suggestions for content and sections to add. Hopefully this site can be an integral part of our league for years to come!</p>

               <p class="scoop">Colleagues and friends,
                <br>
                <br>
                We're officially in the home stretch of the 2024 Wolves of the Rad season! With teams rolling their way into week 11, the fight for the playoffs is in full swing! Currently, 13/14 possible teams are still in contention for a spot but, after this week the league should have a clearer picture of potential playoff teams. Now, despite his official elimination from the playoffs, team owner Jacob “not so promising land” Leitner remains optimistic that his ever looming visit to the cage might be cut short, thanks in large part to a recent trade. Last week also featured one of the more interesting turns of events this season. All seven teams from the NFC found themselves on the winning side of there matchups meaning, the AFC in turn found themselves winless. In what has almost been a microcosmic of this season, many have pegged the NFC as the far superior conference. Last week's games  to watch turned out to be quite the doozy! Patty Cake pulled out the nine point win over Under Rayted behind a historic performance from star wide receiver Jamar Chase. Many, including myself would've immediately waved the white flag but, Under Rayted lived up to his name in almost historic fashion! Meanwhile on the west coast, Freako Collins and Njorkin my peener had another exciting matchup! Despite the final score, both teams scored similarly across the board with an iconic “double trouble” goose egg from their starting wide receivers. However, thanks to the recent breakout of Bengals running back Chase Brown and the dominant showing from Call of Duty fanboy Kyler Murray, Freako got down, dirty, and nasty to pull out the dub! 
                <br>
                <br>
                Week 11 features a trio of important matchups including teams on the rise, the potential fall, teams battling for their season and teams looking to lock up their playoff spot! As your humble writer and servant (I am not the editor however), I shall only briefly touch on the recent performances of my team. So yeah, I been busting ass the past two weeks, on everything that 171 burger I gave out should let people know that the champ is not going down easy. Meanwhile, his/mine (third person?) opponent Shieldsy Show, coming off two straight losses, is looking to bounce back and remain the one seed in the AFC. Both teams at 7-3 feature our highest ranking matchup of the week! Meanwhile, our second and third games to watch feature two 4-6 teams facing off vs. two 6-4 teams facing off. With four straight wins, Saquon Barkley Enthusiast has completely turned his season around! With yet another trade this past week, he finds himself as one, if not the hottest team in the league. Behind his three headed monster in AJ Brown, Barkley, and Bijan Robinson he is aiming for a FIFTH straight win. His opponent BenDover, coming off an extremely tough .6 loss to Let's Go Golfing held several player meetings throughout the week in preparation for this ever so important matchup! Lookout for the potential return of his two star wide receivers as well! The final matchup of the week features our two 4-6 teams, Gibby and Snead. For both teams, week 11 and likely every week going forward, is do or die! Snead, who has seen a transition of power this season, has bounced back in somewhat impressive fashion thanks in large part to his “team mentality”, with a roster featuring very minimal star power. For Gibby, a team that has battled injuries and underperformances all year, he's finally looking to turn the page especially with the looming return of Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco. 
                <br>
                <br>
            
                Much love - Senpai.

                <p>Of course we have to mention the biggest winner. Mr. Maxwell Milo, Senpai himself, won the 2023 Fantasy Football season! Yeah, we all hate him for it. Yeah, it looks like showing up to the draft in a suit and tie might have some luck built-in. Regardless of that, Max pushed through a rough fantasy season, battled Jacob in the championship, and came out on top! Will Max complete a back-to-back tour? Will Zion come back with a vengeance after his championship hangover season? Or will it be a newcomer to the winner's podium to bring home the hardware? Who will win???</p>

                <p>It must be nice to win the chip... good news for our last place manager, he won a chip too! Our 2023 Fantasy Football season last place performer, Mr. Jesse Schuhart, won the honors of the spicy hot Ghost Pepper chip. What's more painful - losing more games than you win? Or eating this chip? We all watched in horror as Jesse tanked the hot chip, and even worse, half a gallon of milk as a chaser. It must be said in writing though - Jesse took this punishment like an absolute CHAMPION! This day might've even sparked a fire in him for our current season.</p>

                <p>Literally in the dog house. This year, the last place team will spend the duration of the draft in the dog cage. Normally a fun and open time to socialize and have fun, for the ENTIRE DRAFT, you'll have to spend your session drafting from a crate. Best not lose!</p>

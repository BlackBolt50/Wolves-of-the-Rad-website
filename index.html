                <h1>Welcome to the Wolves of the Rad Fantasy Football League website</h1>
                <p>This website is my attempt at cataloguing the past, present, and future our long-running fantasy football league. This site will contain sections dedicated to our league history and past champions, weekly rankings, highest and lowest scores, and more. I'm brand new to this, being my first REAL programming project I've done, so bear with the janky-ness and glitches that may come up. As I develop my programming skills, I'd love to add more features. I'll gladly take any suggestions for content and sections to add. Hopefully this site can be an integral part of our league for years to come!</p>

                Left wingers, right wingers, and everyone in between…. 
                <br>
                Welcome to the third edition of Senpais Scoop! Week Nine has officially ended just like the hopes of several of our league mates. The race is officially on for the dog cage! With a three headed race between The Promised Land, Let’s Go Golfing, and Ruggs driving class. Each team finds themselves fighting week in and week out to avoid the “doghouse.” Driving Case, with 2 owners, Halsey and EBABY could potentially force the leagues hands to purchase a substantially bigger dog cage and/or another separate cage. Needless to say, each one of these respected teams is “campaigning” for any hope. Last week's game to watch, featuring Enthusiast (Commish) vs. Show (Shieldys) was once again, a not so close matchup. Show, taking his second loss of the season, is looking to bounce back against another struggling team in Snead. For the commish, this was his quest for a third straight win! After another massive trade for star running back Bijan Robinson, the commissioner is continuing his turnaround season!
                <br>
                <br>
                This week features two games to look out for! Patty Cake, led by owners Zion and Shadique travel east to take on Under Rayted, led by owner Ray. For cake, currently leading the NFC and dominating the league in points scored, is looking to widen the gap and grab the one seed! For Under Rayted, coming off two straight losses and facing some tough bye week decisions, he looks to “flip the house” on his season. The final matchup to watch this week features two 5-4 teams! Peener and Collins (led by owners JJ and Jesse respectively) face off this week in an ever important matchup to potentially determine the fate of their seasons! For both owners, they have struggled all season with injuries and up and down starts. However, both at 5-4 and still find themselves entrenched in playoff contention!
                <br>
                <br>
                As always, our league is built on the 4 F’s. Family, friends, football and fear! Throughout major life changes, elections, historical events, or anomalies, this league survives. Shoutout to all of you for your commitment and love for not just fantasy but for the friend group!
                <br>
                <br>

                Much love - Senpai.

                <p>Of course we have to mention the biggest winner. Mr. Maxwell Milo, Senpai himself, won the 2023 Fantasy Football season! Yeah, we all hate him for it. Yeah, it looks like showing up to the draft in a suit and tie might have some luck built-in. Regardless of that, Max pushed through a rough fantasy season, battled Jacob in the championship, and came out on top! Will Max complete a back-to-back tour? Will Zion come back with a vengeance after his championship hangover season? Or will it be a newcomer to the winner's podium to bring home the hardware? Who will win???</p>

                <p>It must be nice to win the chip... good news for our last place manager, he won a chip too! Our 2023 Fantasy Football season last place performer, Mr. Jesse Schuhart, won the honors of the spicy hot Ghost Pepper chip. What's more painful - losing more games than you win? Or eating this chip? We all watched in horror as Jesse tanked the hot chip, and even worse, half a gallon of milk as a chaser. It must be said in writing though - Jesse took this punishment like an absolute CHAMPION! This day might've even sparked a fire in him for our current season.</p>

                <p>Literally in the dog house. This year, the last place team will spend the duration of the draft in the dog cage. Normally a fun and open time to socialize and have fun, for the ENTIRE DRAFT, you'll have to spend your session drafting from a crate. Best not lose!</p>

                <h1>Welcome to the Wolves of the Rad Fantasy Football League website</h1>
                <p>This website is my attempt at cataloguing the past, present, and future our long-running fantasy football league. This site will contain sections dedicated to our league history and past champions, weekly rankings, highest and lowest scores, and more. I'm brand new to this, being my first REAL programming project I've done, so bear with the janky-ness and glitches that may come up. As I develop my programming skills, I'd love to add more features. I'll gladly take any suggestions for content and sections to add. Hopefully this site can be an integral part of our league for years to come!</p>

               <p class="scoop">Hello Proletariat and Bourgeoisie,
                <br>
                <br>
                Welcome to the very FIRST EDITION of Senpai’s Scoop!! I am very excited to be spearheading this freshly introduced weekly article, which will cover a variety of topics surrounding fantasy football! However, when I accepted this job (no pay at all) (I should be getting paid, right?) I knew, most importantly, that I wanted to cover YOU, our league mates. As one of the founding members of Wolves of The Rad and former commish (fuck you, Jordan), I have had the wonderful opportunity to watch this league grow into the powerhouse it is now. The one constant through all these years has been you guys and all the terrible yet great storylines and stories our league has. I mean, I bet most of you remember or heard of when Jake Hudson drafted Larry Fitz in round 1…. Or how about how Ben was one of the worst fantasy players ever despite his passion and knowledge for the sport (sorry, Ben.)  Going forward, every week, there will be an in-depth summary and analysis for each of our 14 teams. Including rivalries and blowouts;) With that being said….
                <br>
                <br>
                Welcome to Week 8 of Wolves of The Rad fantasy season!!
                <br>
                There seems no more fitting a place to start than injuries. Suffice it to say, this season has been an absolute roller coaster for injuries, and week 7 provided much more of the same. Injuries to Tampa Bay's star WRs have left teams Freako and Snead facing even more uphill battles, as the injury bug and general retardation (Snead) have stricken their respective camps deeply. 8/14 league members currently find themselves with a record over .500 as the second half of the season is sure to end down to the wire once again. With the recent news of a D Hop trade and the potential return of CMC, the Evil Empire is looking like a team to watch in the second half. Meanwhile, BenDover is coming off 2 straight wins with a deep roster. It so happens that they match up this week, which certainly looks like the game of the week! Be on the lookout for more updates and storylines each week as the second half of the season unfolds, and don’t forget the champ is still here. 
                <br>

                <p>Of course we have to mention the biggest winner. Mr. Maxwell Milo, Senpai himself, won the 2023 Fantasy Football season! Yeah, we all hate him for it. Yeah, it looks like showing up to the draft in a suit and tie might have some luck built-in. Regardless of that, Max pushed through a rough fantasy season, battled Jacob in the championship, and came out on top! Will Max complete a back-to-back tour? Will Zion come back with a vengeance after his championship hangover season? Or will it be a newcomer to the winner's podium to bring home the hardware? Who will win???</p>

                <p>It must be nice to win the chip... good news for our last place manager, he won a chip too! Our 2023 Fantasy Football season last place performer, Mr. Jesse Schuhart, won the honors of the spicy hot Ghost Pepper chip. What's more painful - losing more games than you win? Or eating this chip? We all watched in horror as Jesse tanked the hot chip, and even worse, half a gallon of milk as a chaser. It must be said in writing though - Jesse took this punishment like an absolute CHAMPION! This day might've even sparked a fire in him for our current season.</p>

                <p>Literally in the dog house. This year, the last place team will spend the duration of the draft in the dog cage. Normally a fun and open time to socialize and have fun, for the ENTIRE DRAFT, you'll have to spend your session drafting from a crate. Best not lose!</p>
